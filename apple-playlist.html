                This project was a personal endeavour following a previous one related to downloading music from bandcamp automatically. This project was more so about downloading important information that could then be used to search for the music on other platforms because of the known DRM components that sites like Apple Music and Spotify have. Both projects were about removing the reliance of these websites and companies because ultimately music streamed through websites like Apple Music, never belong to the user, a user's "library" is basically being borrowed and not owned. This project also helped improve my skills with web scraping and combining tools like Selenium and Beuatiful Soup to get a complete webpage with all data since components are nowadays added dynamically and directly downloading an html document expecting static content shouldn't be assumed.

        <ul>
          <li>Limited url parsing, only apple music playlists so far</li>
          <li>Some webpage caching is used/possible</li>
          <li>Saving JSON of prevously saved pages to keep a "history" of sorts</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="box development-process">
        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <p>The first part of the project involved figuring out the feasibility of getting a fully loaded page. I explored potential existing options for libraries that could save and parse dynamic web pages. Initially I wanted to create fake requests and just get raw data that way because I didn't like the idea of relying on a library that basically requires the computational power to run an actual browser, which seemed sort of expensive for the task. I still think the web requests is a viable route if more research is done on which parts of the page ask for what content, and if there's a specific way to get just the playlist content info the preformance gain would be significant. I ultimately decided to use selenimum and BS4 and played around with their configuration and what specific classes or tag attributes to seek out once a page was downloaded to only keep the parts of the page that had the playlist data. The custom JSON class library was later implemented along with a method of caching pages so that selenium wouldn't be ran everytime during testing.</p>

      <section class="box future-improvements">
        <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
        <p>As I mentioned, I think narrowing the focus on requests would be a very different but possible solution. I also need to clean up the codebase because as of right now it is pretty messsy and unpresentable.</p>
