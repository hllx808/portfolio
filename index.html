              Hey! I'm an Undergraduate Student at Boston College in my Junior
              year. I'm currently working on a Bachelor's Degree of Science for
              CS and a Minor in Mathematics. I'm extremely passionate about the
              ways in which technology can be used to encourage learning and
              better our world. I run a version of Linux using AwesomeWM as my
              window manager with a very customized configuration that I like to
              tweak every few weeks. I'm involved in an expiremental math lab at
              Boston College where we're trying to use Machine Learning to
              categorize certain Coxeter groups based on their properties. I'm
              also a content tutor at our schools athlete center where I tutor
              introductory CS and Math courses.

              <p>
                The code and implementation of the IIS algorithm was primarily
                developed by me in both python and java with the intention of
                making a readable representation of how the algorithm would work
                in practice. The algorithm itself uses an inversion map with
                relation to a circle to create a visual representation of a
                schottky group using. This idea was introduced and explored by
                undergraduate students from Meiji University so a lot of credit
                goes to their team for creating an efficient method of
                generating the figures without using a composition of mobius
                maps, a method that is computationally less efficient.

                Building upon what was learned from the Bandcamp Project the
                next goal was to be able to parse a more complex dynamic page
                this time with help from well documented libraries. The project
                used Selenium and Beautiful Soup libraries for python which were
                able to take as input the url to an apple music playlist and
                then parse it, and run it through a hidden browser window ran in
                the background using Gecko, Firefox's browser engine, and after
                all dynamic elements were loaded the titles of the songs in the
                playlist as well as those of the artist could then be saved.

                The goal of this project was to create a utility that could turn
                a webpage's messy data and return a programming language
                friendly version of the data to potentially be used in future
                projects.

                Java code using core libraries that downloaded the mp3 tracks of
                an album on bandcamp after taking a valid url as input.

              <p>
                An older project using Java with no web parsing libraries that
                examined aspects of data sent via url's, specifically bandcamp
                url's in order to better understand one of the ways webpages
                receive and send data to servers using a Get method which is
                easier to find the specifics of in a static html page like the
                one's Bandcamp used. Some challenges included created a very
                rudementary abstract syntax tree that mostly detected groupings
                based on brackets in html and json files downloaded from a
                bandcamp url. Then this was parsed to get working links for each
                track on an album page.
