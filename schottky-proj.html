              This project and code specifically was created in the Summer of 2024, for a research project ran by members in the Math Department at Boston College. The first part of half of the research prjoect focused on understanding relvenat concepts relating to group theory, maps, and understanding how a transformation between one geometric space to another is possible. One of the goals of the project was to present these subjects in a more accessible and interesting way. Part of this was achieved through the use of visualizations of figures, like the one on the left, that were generated by the mobius maps we were studying.

        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <p>This project was a team effort and was ccomplished with help from other undergraduate students at BC. Additionally the code is an implementation of a more efficient way of creating a visual representation of mobius maps acting on one another using something called an Iterative Inverse System. This used a regular non-mobius circle inversion map for every pixel until a point was eventually mapped to the identity space. We initially used some code in Java and improved on the preformance given the library that was used to generate it. I later translated it to python and structured the circle generators into classes, including one for circles that visually look like plains due to their infinite border.</p>

      <section class="box future-improvements">
        <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
        <p>Currently I'm trying to add multiprocessing support to break down the work load and use more computational resources on the very large 2x2 array that ends up generating the circle because the time to generate the Gasket for example takes mroe time than I would like.</p>
